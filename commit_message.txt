feat: Re-add missing project files and update to interactive editor

This commit re-adds the previously missing core project files, including:
- viewer.py (Flask application for interactive Markdown editor)
- README.md (Project documentation)
- templates/index.html (Web interface for the editor)
- test.md (Sample Markdown file)

It also ensures that the project is updated to the interactive Markdown editor version with file I/O and enhanced code snippet viewing.
