This commit introduces a significant upgrade to the MarkdownViewer, transforming it into a web-based interactive editor. Key features include:
- Integration of Flask for a robust web server.
- In-browser Markdown editing with real-time HTML preview.
- File loading and saving capabilities directly from the web interface.
- Enhanced code snippet viewing with Pygments-compatible syntax highlighting.
- Refactored project structure with a dedicated 'templates' directory for better organization.
